
About Vitrite
-------------
Vitrite is a tiny utility for Windows 2000 (or newer) that allows you 
to adjust the transparency of almost any visible window. Just click on 
the window you wish to modify and then press:
  Ctrl + Shift + [Any numerical key on the top row of your keyboard]

There are 10 different levels of transparency:
  1 == Most transparent
  [...]
  9 == Least transparent
  0 == No transparency

It's really pretty straightforward.

Another feature of Vitrite is the ability to toggle a window's "always 
on top" flag. Just press "Ctrl Shift +" (that's the plus sign) and it 
will make the active window stay on top of the other windows. Press it
again to reverse this behavior.

Installation
------------
There are two different versions of Vitrite: Self-Extracting Install and 
Zipped Release. For the self-extracting version you just let it run. For 
the zipped version you unzip the files into any directory you want and 
you're good to go. You'll probably want to create a shortcut to it in 
the 'Start Menu'. [Hint: Put it in the 'Startup' group if you want it to 
start every time you turn on your computer.]

Note: I would have distributed it as a single EXE; however, the mechanism 
used for intercepting keyboard messages requires the use of a DLL. It's no 
biggie though, you don't need to put in in your system directory or any-
thing. Just make sure the DLL and the EXE are in the same directory.


Availability
------------
Vitrite is released under the GNU General Public License. You can find 
the actual license in the file named 'GPL.TXT'. I would explain it, but
if you're clever enough to be looking for the source code then you
probably already know. If not go to http://www.fsf.org.

If you'd like to have the source code but don't want to play by the GPL 
rules, you have two choices:
 * Disregard the license and do whatever you want with the source code. 
   Unfortunately, if you do this you'll go to Hell.
 * Or you can contact me and I'll sell you a copy of the source code 
   under the less-restrictive BSD license. [Disclaimer: Use of this option 
   does not guarantee that you don't go to hell; but at least it won't be 
   because you stole my source code.]

listed for me at http://batemail.sourceforge.net.

Enjoy your life,
