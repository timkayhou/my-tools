[2 - DESCRIPTION]
	OpenGL Benchmark / GPU stress test application. This benchmark is focused on fur rendering. 
	Very handy to quickly stress test or benchmark a graphics card.
	
	This benchmark requires an OpenGL 2.0 compliant graphics controller and lot of GPU power!

	For a Vulkan version of FurMark, try the new FurMark 2:
	https://www.geeks3d.com/furmark/v2/

	Please, do not hesitate to drop me an email (jegx@geeks3d.com) if you encouter some bugs.
	
	Run Modes:
	-----------
	- Benchmarking mode: performs a benchmark with score at the end.
	- Burn-in (stability test) mode: runs the benchmark until the user presses the ESC key.
	  This mode is useful to test your graphics card during your overclocking sessions!
	  
	Options:
	--------
	- Xtreme burn-in mode: increase the fur rendering workload to produce more power draw.
	- Fullscreen
	- Window size selection (standard or custom)
	- MSA samples selection
	- Benchmarking parameters: time based or frames based

	Screenshots
	-----------
	Press the F9 key to take screenshots during stress test. Screesnshots
	are saved in the FurMark/screenshots/ folder. It's recommended to start
	FurMark with elevated rights (run as administrator) in order to properly
  	save screenshots.
